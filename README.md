> Making a Video and Music downloader to learn about TKINTER

## 💻 Pre-Requisites

I tested and programed this in Linux (Ubuntu), so i don't know if it will work in other systems.

- [✓] Linux 🐧
- [✓] Windows 🪟
- [Don't have one to test] Mac 🍎

## 🚀 Installing Youtube Downloader

To install the project do this, i recommend using a env:

Linux:

```
python3 -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 main.py
```

if you can't run this because of tkinter try:

```
sudo apt install python3-tk
```

Windows:

```
???
```
